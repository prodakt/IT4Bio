# IT4Bio – Information Technology for Biologists
Lecture notes, scripts, and examples for IT4Bio: R programming basics, data analysis, computational tools, and IT foundations tailored for students in biology and biotechnology.

Teaching materials for courses on information technologies for biology and biotechnology students.  
The repository is continuously updated and contains:

- Introductory R programming (RGui, RStudio, clean code, data structures)
- Working with biological data (FASTA, BLAST, Ensembl, MSA, basic statistics)
- Data visualisation in R (base graphics, ggplot2, plotly, high-quality export)
- Bioinformatics workflows in R (rBLAST, rentrez, MSA, etc.)
- Functions, loops, and working with external packages and repositories (CRAN, Bioconductor, GitHub)
- Using AI tools (ChatGPT, AI Studio, Colab) to support R programming and reproducible analyses

Materials are available in multiple languages (`pl`, `en`, `it`) in the subdirectories of each module.
