# IT4Bio – Information Technology for Biologists
### Lecture notes, scripts, examples, and teaching materials for IT4Bio — an introduction to R programming, data analysis, computational tools, and IT foundations for biology and biotechnology students.

The repository is continuously updated and contains:

- Introductory R programming (RGui, RStudio, clean code, data structures)
- Working with biological data (FASTA, BLAST, Ensembl, MSA, basic statistics)
- Data visualisation in R (base graphics, ggplot2, plotly, high-quality export)
- Bioinformatics workflows in R (rBLAST, rentrez, MSA, etc.)
- Functions, loops, and working with external packages and repositories (CRAN, Bioconductor, GitHub)
- Using AI tools (ChatGPT, AI Studio, Colab) to support R programming and reproducible analyses

Materials are available in multiple languages (`pl`, `en`, `it`) in the subdirectories of each module.
