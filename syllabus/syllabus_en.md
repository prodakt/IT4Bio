# IT4Bio — Information Technology for Biologists and Biotechnologists

## Course Description
This course introduces biology and biotechnology students to practical applications of the R programming language, AI-assisted coding, and foundational IT tools used for biological data analysis. It covers programming basics, biological data import, visualization, bioinformatics workflows and code repositories.

## Learning Outcomes
After completing the course, students will be able to:
- understand R fundamentals and write clean, readable code,
- import and process biological data (FASTA, BLAST, Ensembl, MSA),
- create high-quality, publication-ready visualizations,
- use basic bioinformatics tools in R (e.g., rBLAST, rentrez),
- apply AI tools (ChatGPT, Colab, AI Studio) to assist in coding and analysis,
- write functions, use loops, and work with CRAN, Bioconductor and GitHub.
